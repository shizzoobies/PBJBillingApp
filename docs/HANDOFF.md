# Handoff — PBJBillingApp

Written 2026-07-21. Everything below is live on `main`; the working tree was clean
at handoff. Read this top to bottom before your first change — several rules here
are non-obvious and breaking them has caused a production outage before.

---

## 1. What this is

A time-tracking / recurring-checklist / billing app for **PB&J Strategic
Accounting**, a bookkeeping firm. Deployed at **app.pbjsa.com** (Railway).

**The people** (this matters — the ids are misleading):

| Who | User id | Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Alex Anderson | `emp-alex-anderson` | owner | The developer/user you talk to |
| **Brittany Ferguson** | **`emp-patrice`** | owner | **The real end client.** Feature requests come from her via Alex |
| Lisa Mockabee | `emp-a41095f0` | bookkeeper | ~31 assigned clients |
| Allison Lehmann | `emp-41def8a0` | senior_bookkeeper | ~10 assigned clients |

Alex relays Brittany's feedback, often as tracker items pasted verbatim. **When an
item says "not approved" or "still not working", it has usually been shipped once
already and the problem is interpretation, not code.** See §7.

---

## 2. Architecture cardinal rules

**Stack:** React 19 + TypeScript + Vite (`src/`), plain-Node `http` server
(`server.js`, no framework), dual-backend `db/store.js`.

1. **`db/store.js` has TWO backends** — Postgres when `DATABASE_URL` is set,
   JSON-file otherwise. **Any persisted change must touch BOTH.** Tests run on the
   file backend; production is Postgres, so a Postgres-only bug passes CI silently.

2. **`docs/capability-manifest.md` is load-bearing.** It's the AI assistant's
   knowledge base. Update it with every user-visible feature change, and when you
   do, **re-provision the voice agent after deploying** (§3).

3. **`npm run verify`** = `eslint` + `tsc -b && vite build` + `vitest`. Green
   before every push. Currently **506 tests / 50 files**.

4. Prefer targeted endpoints over the bulk save. `PUT /api/app-data` (the bulk
   workspace save) is **owner-only (403 for staff)** — anything staff must do
   needs its own endpoint.

---

## 3. The ship ritual (follow exactly)

```bash
npm run verify                      # must be green
git add <files> && git commit       # trailer below
git push                            # Railway auto-deploys main
```

Then poll the deploy, health-check, and (only if the manifest changed)
re-provision the voice agent:

```bash
# deploy status — poll until SUCCESS
npx @railway/cli@latest deployment list --service PBJBillingApp --json

# health (expect 200)
APP=$(npx @railway/cli@latest variables --service PBJBillingApp --json \
  | node -e 'const v=JSON.parse(require("fs").readFileSync(0,"utf8"));process.stdout.write(v.APP_PUBLIC_URL)')
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" "$APP/health"

# ONLY when docs/capability-manifest.md changed:
#   export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY / ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID / APP_PUBLIC_URL / VOICE_TOOL_SECRET
#   from `npx @railway/cli@latest variables --service PBJBillingApp --json`, then:
node scripts/provision-voice-agent.mjs
```

## 4. Production diagnostics — the highest-value tool here

**This has caught more real bugs than any other technique.** Repeatedly, code that
passed lint + build + tests was still wrong against real data. Use it.

Get a connection (read-only work needs no permission; see the write rule below):

```bash
export NODE_PATH="D:/PBJ Accounting Work/AP For Time Stuff/node_modules"
DBURL=$(npx @railway/cli@latest variables --service Postgres --json \
  | node -e 'const v=JSON.parse(require("fs").readFileSync(0,"utf8"));process.stdout.write(v.DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL)')
# then: new Pool({ connectionString: DBURL, ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false } })
```

**Two patterns:**

- **Reproduce engine logic against prod data.** Re-implement the function you just
  wrote in plain JS over real rows and print what the user will actually see.
  This is how the "never generates" detector and the payroll by-day/by-job report
  were validated before shipping.
- **Rolled-back write QA.** `BEGIN` … do the exact UPDATE/INSERT your store method
  issues … `ROLLBACK`, then re-select to prove nothing changed. This caught a
  foreign-key violation (writing `client_id = ''` instead of `NULL`) that would
  have shipped.

**Rule: any write that is NOT rolled back needs the user's explicit approval
first.** A past bulk write took production down (see `.omc/` notes / memory
"Plan-refs Outage"). One approved backfill was done this session (177 rows) —
snapshot first, single transaction, re-verify after.

**Schema surprises** (the app-shaped names differ from the columns):
- `time_entries`: `user_id` (not employee_id), `entry_date` (not date),
  `started_at` / `ended_at`, `sessions` jsonb NOT NULL, `client_id` **FK — must be
  `NULL`, never `''`** for administrative time.
- No `employees` table — team members live in **`users`**.
- Template stages/items are separate tables (`checklist_template_stages`,
  `checklist_template_items`), not a column on `checklist_templates`.
- `clients` has only `assigned_bookkeeper_ids`. `assignedEmployeeIds` is a
  frontend/legacy field with **no DB column** — visibility uses bookkeeper ids.

## 5. Where things stand (last 12 commits, newest first)

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `4ddc487` | **To 100%**: new "Checklists" category flagging recurring recipes that will **silently never generate** (missing steps / months / due date / client / assignee, or switched off). Mirrors the materializer's gate. |
| `f358b2b` | Completing a step is **assignee-only**; clock in/out on **every** approval surface; **Clock in/out/Sessions** columns on both raw exports; **"Time"** button + track-time modal on each client row. |
| `006c54e` | **Approval is deletes-only.** Removed pending-edit routing for adds and edits. Staff can **append** to a recurring template via a new append-only endpoint. |
| `c2746d4` | Time entries: edit **every** field (client, task, date, admin toggle); saving resubmits for approval (approved → pending). |
| `d54a793` | Every notification email **names the client** (body line + subject), resolved centrally in `notify()`. |
| `85003a6` | Staff see their clients' **recurring checklists on the main Checklists page** (was buried per-client). |
| `880cb33` | Checklist cards lead with the **client name**; instance-vs-series prompt when adding a task. |
| `4516004` | **Bug fix:** stage 1 of specific-months recipes used the template's month-day instead of its own (`resolveSpecificMonthsStageDueDate`). Included an approved 177-row prod backfill. |
| `bc46a8c` | Payroll report: **time by day by job** + raw-hours export. |
| `c05c415`, `5ad9b84`, `11fccd9` | To-100% UX: collapse-all default, summary strip, checklist quick-preview modal. |

## 6. Open follow-ups

Nothing is half-built — every item above shipped and deployed. These are things I
**flagged to Alex and he hasn't ruled on**; don't do them unprompted.

**Consequences of this session's changes, worth watching:**

1. **Brittany lost edit visibility.** Removing edit-approval means she's no longer
   notified when someone renames a step or changes a due date (the activity log
   still records it). Offered: send a *notification* on edit instead of an
   approval gate. Not built.
2. **Assignee-only completion may be too strict.** If a checklist is assigned to
   one person but the team expects anyone to close steps, they'll hit disabled
   boxes. Offered: a per-checklist "anyone assigned to this client may complete"
   flag. Not built.
3. **Time-entry edits flip approved → pending.** Deliberate ("submit for
   approval"), but may be noisy. Offered: scope it to material changes (client /
   time / date) and leave description-only edits approved.
4. **"This + all future"** adds to the template (future instances) — it does
   **not** retroactively add to other already-open instances. Confirm that's what
   she means if it comes up.
5. **To-100% shows switched-off recipes** as MEDIUM. If deliberate-off is noise,
   hiding them is a one-line change.

**Real data for Brittany to fix (not code):** two recurring recipes have generated
**zero** checklists ever — *Annual Reconciliations with Review · Brentwood United
Pentecostal Church* and *Annual Reports · N568RT, LLC*, both with an empty first
stage. That's real work that hasn't been happening. They now appear in To 100%.

**Tech debt created deliberately:** the `pending_task_edits` queue is now
vestigial — nothing creates new entries, but the approve/reject machinery remains
so pre-existing edits can be resolved. Safe to remove once that queue is empty.

**Deferred by design:** cross-month due dates for specific-months recipes. Do
**not** just remove the within-month clamp in `resolveSpecificMonthsDueDate` — the
materializer's per-month idempotency key is derived from the due date's month, so
an out-of-month date makes the task **respawn on every read**. It needs a stored
scheduled-month marker first.

---

## 7. Working agreements with this user

- **Plan, then build.** For anything non-trivial, propose first. "Push" is the go
  signal. Use structured questions when a decision is genuinely his (or
  Brittany's) — permissions changes and prod writes especially.
- **Ship end-to-end.** A task isn't done at "code written": verify → commit →
  deploy → health-check → re-provision voice if the manifest changed.
- **Re-reports mean re-interpret, not re-code.** The "To 100%" item was rejected
  **three times**; the first two failures were me building the wrong feature from
  a plausible reading. When something comes back, ask what they're looking at, or
  reproduce against prod data — don't just re-implement the same idea harder.
- **Report honestly.** Say what was verified and how, and flag the limits (below).

---

## 8. Known constraints

- **You cannot log into the live UI.** The owner account has TOTP 2FA. Do **not**
  attempt to bypass it (a safety classifier correctly blocks this, and it's
  someone else's account). Verification therefore rests on `npm run verify` plus
  production-data reproduction (§4) — say so plainly rather than implying a
  click-through happened.
- Local dev: `npm run dev` runs Vite + `node server.js`. The **server** (port
  5173) serves `dist/` + same-origin API; Vite's proxy target does not match, so
  use the server port, not Vite's.
- Windows + Git Bash. `.omc/` holds scratch state; machine-local Claude memory
  lives under `~/.claude/projects/…/memory/` — this document is the portable
  source of truth.
